their time. I tend to use emacs [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]] with a series of files
modelled loosely around a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_things_done][GTD]] setup. This for me is a really smooth
way of organising the work I need to do. However most developers will
be expected the  I
have to use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jira_(software)][JIRA]] (which I regard as an absolute abomination).
